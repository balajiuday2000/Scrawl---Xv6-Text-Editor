MAJOR FEATURES OF SCRAWL
 
It’s not your average editor:
 
​​Scrawl has extremely fluid cursor movements. HOME can be used to travel to the start of a line. Scrawl also recognizes page Up, page Down and all our arrow keys can be used. It also has functionalities of a regular editor such as the usage of the return key for a new line, delete key to delete a character, etc.
 
Search:
 
​Scrawl provides the user with functionality to search for the occurrence of a particular string throughout the file. The found string is highlighted in a different colour for easier recognition.
 
Syntax highlighting:
 
​​Based on the type of file scrawl highlights the contents of a file to improve user readability. This improves the efficiency of the work done by the user to a great extent.
 
Smart Save:
 
​​Scrawl provides the functionality to save a user file permanently so that the work done by the user is not lost. Even if the user initiates the quit sequence Scrawl smartly checks whether the file has been saved or not. If it has not been saved then the user must press quit thrice in order to make sure that quitting without saving a file was not an accident.
